Simple react starter with the following config:

- React, ReactDOM
- Webpack 4
- Babel with es2015 and react presets
- Bootstrap (css only, loaded from a cdn in `index.html`)
- work with `.js` or `.jsx` files
- main `application.scss` stylesheet is imported in `index.js` as a module to enjoy hot reloading
